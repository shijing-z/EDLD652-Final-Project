Data Source {.sidebar}
==========
**Data Source**

The data is from the [NYC Squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/).


[NYC Squirrel Census Repo from TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29)


Raw data can be found at [NY Data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

**Visualization #1**

Squirrelâ€™s behaviors in different age groups of squirrels.

**Visualization #2**

Personality and tail position of squirrels.

**Visualization #3**

Geographical effect of Squirrels.
